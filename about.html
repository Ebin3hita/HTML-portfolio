<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ebinehita ISEGHOHIME, a passionate and detail-oriented web developer taking her first steps in the world of coding. I recently started learning HTML and I'm enjoying the process of turning simple ideas into structured real pages.
   </p>

<p>Right now, I'm more focused on mastering the basics i.e writng clean HTML, learning how websites are built and exploring how to make them look good and work properly using CSS. I'm excited to continue to grow my skills, especially in JavaScript, CSS, and beyond hopefully.
  </p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I love to explore new technologies, read about web development trends, and work on personal projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p> This portfolio is a space where I'll be sharing my progress, projects, and everything I build as I grow. I'm eager to learn, improve, and eventually build websites that are both beautiful and very much functional.</p>
